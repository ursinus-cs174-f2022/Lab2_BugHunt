# Buggy Programs

<h3>Bug1.cpp </h3>
<p>
    This program is supposed to compute and print the average of the numbers 1 through 10, which is 5.5.
</p>

<h3>Bug2.cpp</h3>
<p>
    This program should filter out the multiples of 6 in the array 
</p>
<p>
<code>5, 6, 12, 20, 18, 24, 48, 58, 60, 68</code>
</p>
<p>
    which should leave the array 
</p>
<p>
    <code>6, 12, 18, 24, 48, 60</code>
</p>

<h3>Bug3.cpp</h3>
<p>
    This program initializes the first 20 numbers counting by 2, starting at 2, so 
</p>
<p>
    <code> 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40</code>
</p>
<p>
    Then, it's supposed to take the average of every pair of adjacent numbers and create a new array
</p>
<p>
    <code>
        3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39
    </code>
</p>

<h3>Bug4.cpp</h3>
<p>
    This program takes one command line argument, <code>K</code>.  It starts counting from <code>K</code> in increments of <code>K</code>  until there are 10 numbers.  For instance, calling this program with a 4 should yield the numbers
</p>
<p>
    <code>4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40</code>
</p>
